# Doro, the productivity tool

This is a personal project to test a more systemic approach to productivty tools.

## Why?

As I was trying to get more productive, looking for tools to help me, I noticed a few things:

- The pomodorro apps were not as good as I wanted (I do not want to pay for a timer)
- The todo apps never get things done because they do not track the work in progress (WIP), so they never enable us to reduce it and get one thing done at a time (Kanban view helps in this matter)
- No way to prioritize correctly (eisenhower matrix would be useful, flagging is not sufficient)
